Copy the project folder in www of AppServ (i.e. C:\AppServ\www\PHP_MySQL_Simple_Project).

Create the database in mySQL exactly as mentioned in the php files (i.e. the exact names for the attributes and table).
For these codes, the table name in the database is 'users'.
The attributes are 'ID' (auto-increment), 'Name' (varchar), 'Email' (varchar).

In the codes for the following line-
mysqli_connect("localhost","db_user","cpsc471","patient_medication");
host = "localhost"
username = "db_user"
password = "cpsc471"
database_name = "patient_medication"
Use your own values for these.
If 'root' is not your username then use your username.
Use the correct 'root' password (i.e. the password for your MySQL) instead of 123456. 
Use the database name for your database.

Open browser.
Type localhost.
Type the folder name of your project and the php file name you want to execute. (i.e. http://localhost/PHP_MySQL_Simple_Project/view.php)
